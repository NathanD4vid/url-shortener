# url-shortener

This is a URL shortener project, developed as part of my return to studying Java (Spring Boot), React, and databases. I used a MongoDB image running in Docker containers, with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) as the development environment.

The main goal was to reinforce full stack development concepts, including integration between frontend and backend, data persistence using a NoSQL database, and containerization to simplify the execution environment.
